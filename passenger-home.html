      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Is it mandatory to take a printout of the ticket ?</summary>
        <div>
          It depends on the bus operator you have booked your ticket with. Even
          mTickets are available on redBus. For operators that support mTickets,
          the SMS that is sent to your mobile can be produced at the time of
          boarding and you will be allowed to travel. <br /><br />
          For operators that do not support mTickets it is a must to take a
          printout of the e-ticket and produce it at the time of boarding. The
          e-ticket is sent to the e-mail ID provided at the time of boarding.
        </div>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>I've lost my ticket. What should I do now ?</summary>
        <div>
          A copy of the ticket would have been sent to you by e-mail when you
          booked it. Please take a printout of that mail and produce it at the
          time of boarding. If you have not received the ticket e-mail, please
          call any of our call centers and our executive will re-send you a copy
          by mail.
        </div>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is an mTicket ?</summary>
        <div>
          An mTicket is an SMS that is sent to your mobile on booking a ticket
          with select operators. This SMS has the TIN number and the PNR number
          along with other ticket related information. It can be used to board
          the bus. Please note that not all operators accept mTickets. To know
          which operators are mTicket enabled, look for the mTicket icon under
          the mTicket column while searching for buses.
        </div>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Does booking online cost me more ?</summary>
        <div>
          Not at all! The price of the bus ticket is the same as you would get
          from the bus operator too.The price of hotel voucher is the same or
          sometimes discounted depending on the season/time.
